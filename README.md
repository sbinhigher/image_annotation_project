### 🖼️ Image Labeling Project for Object Detection
This repository documents the planning, execution, and quality control process of an image labeling project for object detection tasks.  
It aims to provide a reproducible and scalable guideline for preparing high-quality annotated datasets.
> ⚠️ **Notice**
>
> This repository is created to share personal experience in planning and operating an image labeling project for object detection.
> Feedback, suggestions, and discussions about the process are very welcome!

#### 📌 Project Overview
- **Goal**: To build a reliable and high-quality annotated image dataset for training object detection models.
- **Scope**:
  - Planning and defining labeling guidelines
  - Tool selection and environment setup
  - Labeling task management and monitoring
  - Quality assurance (QA) processes
- **Target Model** : [YOLOv7](https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7)
- **Annotation** : Instance Segmentation
- **Annotation Tool** : [labelme.py](https://github.com/wkentaro/labelme)
